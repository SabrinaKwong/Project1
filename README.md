 The Human Body: A Restorative Vessel Project
 
 My piece explores the concepts of healing with somantics in a technological way. Created using Maya and A-frames, this body vessel's purpose is to bring awareness to how our
    bodies are capable of growth and change during stressful times. With parts of the body becoming a represenation of healing, meditation and movement, this is an monument of 
    an abstract body capable of responses towards trauma.
