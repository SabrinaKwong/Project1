 The Human Body: A Restorative Vessel Project

 My piece explores the concepts of healing with somatics in a technological way. Created using Maya and A-frames, this body vessel's purpose is to bring awareness to how our
    bodies are capable of growth and change during stressful times. With parts of the body becoming a representation of healing, meditation and movement, this is an monument of
    an abstract body capable of responses towards trauma.
  Inspired by the natural elements found in receiving energy from nature, specifically QiGong. The lying posture of one's hand facing the ceiling is called Lao Gong and is suitable for those who have low blood pressure, slow heart beats or for those who are easily fatigued.
