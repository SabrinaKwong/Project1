      My piece explores the concepts of healing with somantics in a technological way. Created using Maya and A-frames, this body vessel's purpose is to bring awareness to how our
       bodies are capable of growth and change during stressful times. With parts of the body becoming a represenation of healing, meditation and movement, this is an monument of an
       abstract body capable of responses towards trauma.

      Based on my expereinces as being Asian American during this pandemic, I have resorted to more traditional healing methods to release trauma stored in one's body and generations past. The color red is the represenations of one's resistance while the dark body is then the vessel to be looked upon.</p>

      Inspired by the natural elements found in receiving energy from nature, specifically QiGong. The lying posture of one's hand facing the ceiling is called Lao Gong and is sutable for those who have low blood pressure, slow heart beats or for those who are easily fatigued.
