<h1>
  The Human Body: a Restorative Vessel
</h1>
<h2>
  By Sabrina Kwong
</h2>
    <p>
      My piece explores the concepts of healing with somantics in a technological way. Created using Maya and A-frames, this body vessel's purpose is to bring awareness to how our
       bodies are capable of growth and change during stressful times. With parts of the body becoming a represenation of healing, meditation and movement, this is an monument of an
       abstract body capable of responses towards trauma.

      Baes on the expereinces as being Asian American during this pandemic, I have resorted to more traditional healing methods to release trauma stored in one's body and generations past. </p>
